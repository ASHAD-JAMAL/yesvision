    <h1>M.Tech Course Details</h1>
    <p class="para a">M.Tech is a two-year-long postgraduate program that deals with existing technologies and gives a gateway toward
        technical research. The M.Tech course has tremendous specialization according to one's undergraduate degree in
        engineering. <br>There is a lot of job scope and opportunities for graduates of this course. Some of the popular
        job roles students start with include Senior Software Engineer, Software Engineer, Design Engineer, Assistant
        Professor, Postsecondary / Higher Education, Software Developer, Sr. Software Engineer / Developer / Programmer,
        etc</p>
    <p class="para a">M.Tech full form is Master of Technology. According to Wikipedia, "In India, a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or a
        Master of Technology (M.Tech.) or a Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.) degree is a postgraduate
        program in the engineering field.<br> It is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in MSc.Engg.) after
        completing a 4-year undergraduate degree in engineering (Bachelor of Engineering – B.E. or Bachelor of
        Technology – B.Tech.). Integrated M.E./M.Tech. many institutions also offer degree (B.E./B.Tech. + M.E./M.Tech.)
        program of 5-year duration." Students' popular specializations are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
        Data Science, Mechatronics, Software Engineering, etc.</p>
    <h2 class="head2">Eligibility Criteria for M.Tech</h2>
    <p class="para b">For admission to the Master of Technology course, the students need to know about the course's eligibility
        criteria. The M.Tech eligibility criteria include candidates must have passed the qualifying examinations of all
        semesters in B.Tech/B.E.<br> The candidate has to write a relevant entrance examination, State PGCET, GATE
        specific university entrance tests, etc., based on which they will be ranked and selected for the relevant
        streams.<br> Additionally, in the M.Tech course, students must get the minimum cut-off marks for their
        undergraduate. There is no M.Tech age limit for admission</p>
    <h2>Types of M.Tech</h2>
    <p class="para b">The Master of Technology is a postgraduate degree that can be obtained upon completion of the BTech.
        <br>Applicants can opt for a regular M.Tech or a part-time M.Tech. Some of the M.Tech specializations are listed
        below</p>
    <ul class="list_course">
        <li>Part-Time M.Tech</li>
        <li>Full Time M.Tech</li>
        <li>Distance M.Tech</li>
        <li>Online M.Tech</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>M.Tech Courses</h2>
    <p class="para b">The M.tech course duration is of two years. M.Tech provides you with insight and deep knowledge of the subjects you have studied in your B.Tech course. There are specializations available in engineering areas of specialization. </p>
    <p class="para b">It is a higher specialization course in engineering that focuses on more advanced levels of concept and implementation in the area taken up for specialization in the Computer Science Domain.</p>
    <p class="para b">M.Tech syllabus is designed to offer eligible candidates the requisite skills needed in the application, research, and development activities in emerging areas of engineering technology. The Master of Technology/Engineering course is offered by most Public and Private Universities in India. </p>
